# dlnd-image-classification
In this project, I'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
# Dataset
The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. 
# Preprocess
I'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. 
The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. 
# Method
I'll build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. 
# Result
At the end, you'll get to see my neural network's predictions on the sample images.
